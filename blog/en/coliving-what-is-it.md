### But what exactly is coliving?

Coliving is a form of cohabitation where individuals deliberately share living spaces while seeking community, collaboration, and an enriching social experience. It goes beyond simple roommateship, emphasizing the creation of intentional communities.

### Characteristics of Coliving:

1. **Well-Designed Shared Spaces:** Colivings offer well-designed communal spaces, fostering interactions among residents. From shared kitchens to relaxation areas, everything is designed to create a welcoming atmosphere.
2. **Inclusive Services:** Many colivings provide inclusive services such as cleaning, internet, and sometimes even organized social activities, simplifying residents' daily lives.
3. **Lease Flexibility:** Coliving often offers flexible leases, catering to the changing needs of residents, particularly suitable for mobile individuals (such as digital nomads) or frequent travelers.

### Advantages of Coliving:

1. **Cost Savings:** Sharing expenses like rent and services can lead to substantial savings for residents.
2. **Network Building:** Coliving facilitates the creation of personal and professional networks, providing residents the opportunity to meet like-minded individuals.
3. **Social Well-Being:** By creating spaces where interactions are encouraged, coliving addresses the fundamental need for social belonging, reducing feelings of isolation.

### Is 2024 the New Era of Living Together?

Coliving emerges as an innovative response to the changing needs of modern society.

By creating intentional communities, coliving offers more than just a roof; it provides a enriching living experience centered around collaboration, conviviality, and self-discovery within a dynamic community.

By embracing this practice, we witness the evolution of a new era of living together, where the focus is on human connection and sharing experiences. üåçüè°‚ú®
