### Brief History: Building with a Broad Sense

The desire to build led me to a degree in civil engineering and sustainable construction.

Building â€“ a simple word that evokes both dreams and apprehension. I have always been fascinated by "makers," those bold visionaries who roll up their sleeves to bring their dreams to life, bravely facing the fear of failure.

However, after exploring the construction industry, I realized that ancient traditions and resistance to change would not align with my aspirations, prompting me to change course.

Creating something, being able to redefine the rules to improve the world (on our scale) is what excites me.

Indeed, my experiences in boarding school from middle school as a young firefighter, then a student in a military high school, confirmed my taste for sharing and success.

### Meaning in a Changing World

Guided by a need for meaning in a constantly changing world, I found my path in the digital realm. In an era where the quest for meaning surpasses mere professional success, I learned to code and navigate the digital landscape, where the speed of change matched my personal quest.

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst, forcing society to refocus on its values, questioning traditional patterns of life and work, prompting deep reflection on our living conditions.

In this rapidly changing world, the market for travelers and nomadic workers is constantly expanding. This trend has intensified with the pandemic, where remote work has opened up new possibilities for those who want to explore the world while staying connected professionally.

### From Reflection to Action: Cazamate Comes to Life

The origin of Cazamate is deeply connected to my life journey, but the triggering event occurred when my partner had to face various challenges to find housing in the United States. These obstacles ranged from cultural differences to legislative subtleties, and sometimes misleading advertisements.

It is in this context that Cazamate took shape, driven by the desire to provide a solution for those who, like my partner, venture beyond their homes.

In response to the shortcomings observed on existing platforms such as [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/), which, while satisfying for recreating a home away from home, seem to overlook the authenticity of human cultural encounters.

Cazamate aspires to position itself as an innovative bridge, merging the proven success of Airbnb with the authenticity of encounters that can be experienced in shared housing, whether permanent or temporary. Our particular focus is on seeking authentic experiences and cultural discoveries.

### Cazamate: More Than a Platform, a Community

Our mission is clear: **to give everyone the opportunity to find shared housing worldwide**.

Cazamate's ambition is to create a community that aims to nurture human connections. Each accommodation becomes a gateway to new friendships and experiences.

With [Cazamate](https://www.cazamate.com/), housing is not just a simple reservation; it's a human experience, an unforgettable chapter in your life story.
