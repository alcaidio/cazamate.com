### 1. Waste Sorting and Recycling

Implementing a waste sorting system in your shared living space is a first step towards a more sustainable life.

Assign specific bins for recycling paper, plastic, glass, metal, batteries, medications, and food waste for composting...

Encourage your roommates to adopt this eco-friendly habit.

### 2. Responsible Energy Consumption

Raise awareness among your roommates about responsible energy use.

Turn off lights and electronic devices when not in use. Avoid heating unused rooms; you can also reduce heating by bundling up or using a hot water bottle 😇

Opt for energy-efficient LED bulbs and consider using eco-friendly appliances.

### 3. Responsible Shopping

When shopping for the shared living space, prioritize local and organic products. Avoid excessive packaging by opting for bulk items or using reusable bags. Also, encourage reducing meat consumption to lower carbon footprint.

### 4. Water Conservation

Pay attention to water consumption. Quickly fix leaks, use low-flow showerheads, and be mindful of your daily water usage.

You can also establish simple rules, such as not letting water run while brushing teeth or doing dishes.

### 5. Urban Gardening

If you have outdoor space, consider creating a small urban garden. Growing your own herbs, fruits, and vegetables can be rewarding and reduces the need for packaged products. It also brings in some biodiversity by attracting pollinators. And it's nice to have butterflies as company with your coffee ^^lol

### 6. Upcycling and Donation

Before discarding items, consider the possibility of repairing or donating them. Upcycling gives new life to old items while reducing waste. Also, organize donation sessions among roommates to share unused items.

### 7. Educate and Raise Awareness

Organize discussions in the shared living space about the importance of ecology. Share information about small actions that can have a big impact, like biking, rollerblading, or using public transportation.

Encourage active participation from everyone to create an eco-responsible community.

### Conclusion: Collective Commitment to the Planet

By adopting these eco-friendly practices in your shared living space, you contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and the preservation of our planet. Collective commitment to ecology can create a positive atmosphere within the living space, showing that every small gesture counts in building a greener future. 🌍💚🏡
